# Main Concept
This is meant to be a learning tool.  In this project, it highlights the main concepts of spinning up an application, connecting to a postgres database, setting up a model and highlighting what controllers do for us.

After this mini-lesson, what is completed is a CRUD functionality of an apartment unit for a fictional apartment manager.  No user sign-up or validation is used in this project.

In detail:
- Creating the basic structure.
- linking via a `db.js` to PgAdmin
- setting up an apartment model
- setting up controllers to interact.
